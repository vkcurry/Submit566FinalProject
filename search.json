    "text": "Welcome to Vikasâ€™ final project for PM566 at USC.\nHere, we will be able to ascertain whether the food and water borne illnesses are more prevalent during the colder or warmer times of the year. Various cities across the United States will be utilized in this study to see the potential effects of geographical areas in foodborne disease cases. In addition, for exploratory purposes, the summary statistics of the 5 pathogens will be looked at as well to see if there is a particular pathogen that causes more cases than others and how spread out all 5 of them are, in terms of isolates. The seasonal statistics will be presented as well in the additional figures tab.\nBelow are tables and graphs depicting the average monthly trends for both temperatures and isolates nationwide across the cities selected for this study. They are more individually (city by city) studied in the additional figures tab.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:data.table':\n\n    between, first, last\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(dtplyr)\nlibrary(quarto)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'kableExtra'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    group_rows\n\n## Reading in main data and temperature data and merging them. \nbeam &lt;- data.table::fread(\"/Users/vikaskunta/Downloads/BEAM_Dashboard_-_Isolates_by_HHS_Region_20231016.csv\")\nweather_temps_monthly &lt;- read_excel(\"~/Documents/USC MS/PM 566 Health Data Science/Midterm/weather temps monthly.xlsx\")\nmerge &lt;- beam %&gt;%\n     left_join(weather_temps_monthly, by = c(\"HHS_Region\", \"Month\"))\n\n## Summary Statistics of Monthly Temperature and Isolates.

This would mean that the majority of pathogens spread during the summer time and are more stagnant towards the winter time and cooler months of the year."
